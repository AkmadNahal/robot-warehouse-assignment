This folder holds an integrated version of all current files that will run on the robot.

05/03/2017:

The contents of this folder are relatively new, separating motion code from the code that
will run on the PC. Currently, there's little functionality, since the communication code
is not yet available, that will connect the 'NXT PC' code and the 'NXT Runtime' code.

Eventually, this will integrate with the PC files, waiting for it to connect the robot
to the file running on the computer, which will then send it commands, and the robot will
send commands back, through robot interface.

Progress of Motion Control

Updates to motion control (updates are written in the order in which they were implemented)

1 - Behaviour architecture created. Robot can now move along the grid, detect junctions and follow a pre-defined route (an ArrayList of type Direction)

2 - Adjustments to route following. After each movement is carried out, the robot will re-orientate to the same pose that it started. This avoids possible
problems with system as it no longer has to take into account robots current pose on the grid.

3 - Added a line following mechanic in the base drive behaviour. This will alleviate the unreliabilty in the robots sensors and motors. I.e. if the robot does not
fully rotate 90 degrees etc. Also reduced the robots travel speed as to make line following more reliable.

4 - reduced speed and implemented the average light value read from the sensors. This was added due to inconsistencies with detecting a junction when one wasnt present.

5 - increased the number of times the robot checks whether it is actually on the a junction.

6 - Added another Direction type called STOP which will halt the route execution and the robot will stay in place. This was added to accomodate the new multi - robot route planning
algorithm.

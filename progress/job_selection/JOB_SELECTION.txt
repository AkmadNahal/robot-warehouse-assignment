The 2 reader classes are the fundamental part of the job selection as they read the input of the jobs/items from the given files. Each one reads required files (Job -> jobs.csv, Items -> items.csv and locations.csv) line by line and forming a map of each items/jobs. The Item class has a name, a Location (helper class), a weight and a reward. It has getters for all of these, and a full constructor (so no item can be unnamed, no location etc...).
The Job class is quite more complex. It has an ID (read from file) and a map of picks. (Item name, count of item). When reading a job, it is passed a full list of items (hence item reading is done first) and then adds these items to the pick map. It has getter methods for the picks, and a totalReward() and totalWeight() method to allow other programs (and itself) to get these information. I added a compare to method which compares the jobs based on their total reward (for now). This means that when the list of jobs is made, it can be sorted and this will sort the list of jobs into order of descending reward (highest first). Therefore, when we pick jobs we just loop through the job list.
